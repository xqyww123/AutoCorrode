  /** Definition of a single Anthropic tool this plugin exposes.
    *
    * Every tool listed in [[tools]] falls into one of four semantic classes
    * — callers should treat these as the informal typing for each handler:
    *
    *   - '''Pure query''': read-only, no side effects (e.g. `read_theory`,
    *     `search_theories`, `get_entities`). Safe to retry; handler body
    *     never mutates disk, IDE state, or Isabelle's document model.
    *   - '''I/Q introspection''': calls into the I/Q MCP backplane to learn
    *     about the current Isabelle session (e.g. `find_theorems`,
    *     `get_processing_status`). Requires I/Q plugin available; handlers
    *     return a user-visible error when it is not.
    *   - '''Mutation''': writes to the user's disk or to the editor
    *     (`edit_theory`, `create_theory`). Subject to I/Q's mutation-roots
    *     authorization; errors on Left should be surfaced verbatim so the
    *     user can adjust their settings.
    *   - '''Interactive / heavy''': synchronously blocks the turn on a
    *     long-running or user-prompt operation (`ask_user`,
    *     `run_sledgehammer`, `run_nitpick`). These interact with the
    *     ToolPermissions flow (AskAtFirstUse) and may return ask-user
    *     denied errors.
    *
    * Handlers are wired to tool IDs in the `toolHandlers` map below. When
    * adding a new tool, also update `ToolPermissions.defaultPermissions`
    * and `toolDescriptionsById`, and add test coverage in
    * `ToolIdTest.scala`, `AssistantToolsTest.scala`, and
    * `ToolPermissionsTest.scala`. See CONTRIBUTING.md 'Adding a New Tool'.
    *
    * @param id          Stable identifier; `id.wireName` is the string the
    *                    LLM sees in tool-use responses
    * @param description One-line purpose statement shown to the model;
    *                    include return-shape and edge-case notes here
    * @param params      JSON-schema parameters the tool accepts */

    * Order does not affect selection — Anthropic picks by semantic match
